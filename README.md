# üåê Identity Reconciliation: Identify Contact API

A Django REST Framework application to manage contact identities based on email and phone numbers. The system detects and merges contacts into a single primary identity while linking all secondary information (emails and phone numbers) to avoid duplication and ensure consistency.


## üîß Problem Statement

Build an API endpoint `/identify/` that, given an email and/or phone number, identifies a contact and maintains associations between entries with overlapping information. The logic must ensure:

- **Primary contact** is created when no existing match is found.
- **Secondary contacts** are created and linked if a match is found (via either email or phone number).
- If multiple existing contacts are matched, they are **merged** under the earliest primary contact (by creation time).

---

## üß™ Example Behavior

1. `POST /identify/` with:
```json
{
    "email": "a@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": "8888"
}
```

2. `POST /identify/` with:
```json
{
    "email": "b@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": "8888"
}
```

## Features
- Link multiple emails and phones to a contact.
- Merge duplicate contacts on the fly.
- Return consistent response schema with:
  -primaryContactId
  -List of all emails, phoneNumbers
  -secondaryContactIds
